# flutter_ui_demo

Flutter exercise and my approach to it.

## The exercise:

Prepare a simple application template with the following features:

Homepage: add a login button and an add photo button.

The login button should display a screen with login credentials, password recovery, or registration options if the user does not have an account (do not implement actions on the buttons or change the view).

The add photo button should lead to a screen where the user can add a photo. It should allow the user to import photos from their phone's gallery. Upon importing a photo, there should be a message indicating that better quality photos can be taken using the app's camera feature.

The second option for adding a photo is to take a photo using the camera widget. The camera should have default settings established by the application, such as ISO at 100, flash off, 2-second timer, and aspect ratio of 4:3.

After adding a photo, a new window should open displaying the captured image.
