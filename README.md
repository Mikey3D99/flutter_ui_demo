# flutter_ui_demo

Showcase of basic flutter functionalities, using:
image_picker: ^0.8.6+4
fluttertoast: ^8.0.7

## Getting Started

This version has a different look from the main one - after adding a photo, we are instantly redirected to the previous widget which now contains the photo.
Main version turns on a different page/view with the image itself.
